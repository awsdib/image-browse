# Image Browse

A cross-platform app for browsing image boards.

Image Browse is a work-in-progress app for browsing image hosting/sharing sites like
[Imgur](http://imgur.com/) and [Gelbooru](http://gelbooru.com/). It's cross platform and designed
to support a variety of websites. Currently only Gelbooru-based sites are targeted but as more of
the core functionality is implemented more sites will be added. To request functionality open an
issue with your request.

## Features

- Enter the site you want to browse on the home page to go to that site's gallery.
- View thumbnails in the gallery view, click on an image to see the image and its tags.
- Click on a tag when viewing an image to search for images with the same tag.
- Scroll to the bottom in the gallery view to load more images.

## Planned Features

- Swipe forever in the image view to keep loading images in the gallery.
- Favorite tags to quickly search for them later.
- Save images directly to your device.
- Save favorite sites and add them to your homepage.
- Search multiple sites at once.
- Filter out adult content and images with specific tags.
